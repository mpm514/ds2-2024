# COSC 3337 - Data Science I 
## Decison Trees, SVM, and K-NN Assignment ##

### Due Date: October 11, 11:56 PM ###

#### The goal of this assignment is to:
1. Understand how decision trees, k-nn, and support vector machines (SVMs) are used for classification tasks.
2. Learn to tune hyperparameters in decision trees, k-nn, and SVMs to avoid overfitting.
3. Gain proficiency in using recall, precision, and accuracy as metrics for evaluating classification model performance.
4. Learn to use cross-validation techniques to assess model performance.

## Dataset - Emotion Recognition
**Intended Outcome:** Apply machine learning algorithms for the task of emotion recognition in tweets. This assignment will focus on understanding and implementing classification algorithms such as decision trees, k-nearest neighbors (k-nn), and support vector machines (SVMs). Students will also gain skills in model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

**Dataset Description:** The dataset for this assignment is adapted from the SemEval2018's "Affects in Tweets" task. Originally a multi-label classification problem involving 11 emotions, it has been transformed into a multi-class classification problem for this assignment. Only tweets labeled with a single emotion are considered, and the assignment will focus on the four most common emotions: Anger, Joy, Sadness, and Optimism.

**Dataset Preprocessing:** The original dataset consisted of 'text' and 'label' columns. The text has been preprocessed with user mentions anonymized by a @USER token, line breaks and website links are removed. Following preprocessing, the Universal Sentence Encoder is used to create sentence embeddings for each tweet, afterwhich Principal Component Analyses is applied and the embedding dimensions reduced from 512 to 128. 

**Attributes**

The text column is not expected to be used in this assignment. It is presented for the students reference of the original tweet. The features used for this assignment are the 128 Principal Components dervied from the original 512 dimensonal sentence embedding. 
- *text*: Original text of the tweet
- *Class labels for each tweet*
    - Anger: 0
    - Joy: 1
    - Optimism: 2
    - Sadness: 3
- *feature columns*
    - enc_0 to enc_127

*Dataset pre-processed by Tuck, Bryan, E.*
